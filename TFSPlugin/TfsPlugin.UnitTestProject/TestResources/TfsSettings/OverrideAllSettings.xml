  <!-- Pipe delimited list of colon separated TFS server path:boolean pairs. Will set the lock type used when locking ExclusiveCheckoutFileTypes files.
    A check-out lock prevents other users from checking out and making changes to the locked item in their workspaces.
    A check-in lock is less restrictive than a check-out lock. If you apply a check-in lock, users can continue to make local changes to the item in other workspaces.
    However, those changes cannot be checked in until you remove the lock or check in your changes (if the file is non-mergable, one users version will be stomped).
    Can be specified per server path. Valid values are None, Checkin or Checkout. The default value is Checkout.
    ex. "$/:Checkout|$/ProjectA:Checkin". -->
  <LockLevels>$/:Checkin</LockLevels>

  <!-- Boolean value.
    When True Unity will allow the user to save unsaved changes if a ExclusiveCheckoutFileTypes file is unable to be checked out and locked.
    When False Unity will NOT allow the user to save unsaved changes if a ExclusiveCheckoutFileTypes file is unable to be checked out and locked.
    Default value of True.

Integration Tests
-----------------

This will start a version control server, checkout a working copy and exercise the
plugins using command files (e.g. Test/Perforce/04_Status.txt)

A command file consists of a request section followed by a response section delimited by "--". 
Possibly followed by more request/response sections:

As an example for getting the status of a file:

c:status
1
./Test/tmp/testclient/testfile.txt
0
--
o1:-1
o1:./Test/tmp/testclient/testfile.txt
o1:42
d1:end of list
r1:end of response
--



Some macros are supported that can be put in the command files:

<root>    The relative path to the workspace e.g. Test/tmp/testclient
<absroot> The absolute path to the workspace e.g. /Users/foobar/VersionControlPlugins/Test/tmp/testclient
<ignore>  Placed at the start of a line to ignore it when matching responses

<include [path]> Include another command file at this point. e.g. <include ./Test/Perforce/02_Configure.txt>
